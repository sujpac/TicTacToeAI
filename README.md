# TicTacToeAI

The goal of this project is to build an optimized Tic-Tac-Toe AI. This is done
by breaking it up into a few smaller sub-projects:

1. Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game or "engine" that allows two human players to play
against each other locally
2. Insert basic AI's into this game
3. Repeatedly play AI's against each other to see which of them is the best
4. Add minimax AI that always plays the optimal move
